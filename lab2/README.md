--------


Challenges and how we solved them:
- Challenge: Constitution text is very long â†’ difficult to display without overwhelming users.  
  Solution: Used `<details>/<summary>` accordions and two-column panels for readability.

- Challenge: Keeping semantic HTML for accessibility.  
  Solution: Carefully applied correct heading and section elements; tested with screen readers.

- Challenge: Agreeing on analysis style across group members.  
  Solution: Created a shared annotation template (Purpose, History, Modern Relevance) and standardized language.

- Challenge: Deciding what type of CSS color scheme and font would be the most suitable for the Constitution.  
  Solution: Switched to a more professional navy/red/white palette to match civic design aesthetics.
