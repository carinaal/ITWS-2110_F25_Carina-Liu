ITWS 2110 LAB 1 - Work Log

 - created a neat filepath to ensure that html files are organized and easily accessible. I made sure that the group page index.html file was outside, and then individual work and respective files are organized neatly in folders

9/17
- added the sections: objective, education, work experience, skills. 
- added hCard classes for contact info
stuck: had a bit of trouble on the formatting. I wanted a left bar on the side that filled up the entire page, and the right section to scroll. I also wanted to organize the contents in a specific way and had to mess around with many different functions to get it the way I wanted it to look
- my right column was overlapping with the sidebar , so I implemented "box-sizing: border-box" and removed the default body margin
- wanted to change the font, so I imported a font family

9/18
- In my HTML file, I needed to do some research to refresh my memory on the tags, and how to format. Had to use the HTML file validator to find errors and fix invalid tags. ex: remvoing an invalid <i></i> tag
- validated my CSS and HTML file, and fixed any errors
